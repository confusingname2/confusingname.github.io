   <p class="text">It is factual and proven by the historical record that Jesus Christ was prophesied, lived, ministered, and was crucified. These things being true, you will find it difficult to reconcile a non-Christian narrative with reality, by any means but ignorance. No aspect of reality conflicts with the word of Christ, the creation is nothing without the creator, and inseparable from Him, and no man will find himself complete until he has reconciled with the Lord.</p> 
  <p> If you can muster the faith to trust that God will heal you, please, approach him holding in you all the sorrow of your life, <a href=""> <p style="color: red;"> and ask Him to reveal himself to you </p> </a>
